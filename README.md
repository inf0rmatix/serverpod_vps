This guide details everything you need to set up your Serverpod VPS deployment
using Docker and GitHub Actions. **serverpod_vps** is designed to help you
implement the guide quickly and efficiently by generating all the required
configuration and deployment files.

## Overview

**serverpod_vps** is a companion CLI tool that streamlines the creation of a
production-ready deployment configuration for Serverpod projects. It automates
file generation for Docker deployments and integrates seamlessly with GitHub
Actions to facilitate continuous deployment to your Virtual Private Server.

## Where to start

   cd my_serverpod_project
   ```

2. **Run the CLI Tool:**

   ```bash
   serverpod_vps
   ```

3. **Follow the Interactive Prompts:**

   - Enter your email address for SSL certificate notifications.
   - Confirm or adjust deployment settings as needed.

The tool will generate all necessary deployment files and configuration
settings, helping you implement the steps outlined in the [Serverpod VPS
